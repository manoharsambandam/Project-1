Answers to Channels and Kernels
1.Kernels are filters to extract feature of specific kind. 
   What we did in the assignment is a filter for example edge, blur or sharpen filter
Channels are information containers which contain data more typically extracted out using the kernel / filters.
In the simplistic case a raw color image itself contains 3 channels R,G,B ( or other formats)
   Each channel representing the intensity of these channel data at each pixel point in the image
   
2. Why should we only (well mostly) use 3x3 Kernels?
  a. These kernel size are used typically because they are implemented in hardware processing engines
  and can be accelerated when the application kernels are of the same size
  b. A 3x3 kernel will have a lot less parameters compared to a 5x5 or a 7x7 and, I guess, it is shown to have the same 
  functional performance as the the larger kernels and with a lot less computation the same desired functionality can be achieved by 3x3 kernels
  
3.How many times do we need to perform 3x3 convolution operation to reach 1x1 from 199x199 (show calculations)
    199x199 | 197 x 197 | 195 x 195 | 193x 193 |191 x 191 |
    189x189 | 187 x 187 | 185 x 185 | 183x 183 |181 x 181 |
    179 ....
    169
    159
    149
    139
    129
    119
     99
     ..
     11x11| 9x9 | 7x7 | 5x5 | 3x3 | 1x1
     
     Total of 5 x 18 = 90 stages of 3x3 kernel operations to reach the 1x1 final output
     In each stage  the 3x3 matrix multiplication happens n-1 x n-1 times where n ranges from 199 to 3 in steps
